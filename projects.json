What I can say is that it's the biggest project I've worked on, and I've had the opportunity to build it alongside industry veterans while still taking on a lot of responsibility. Interacting with the AI agents is done by layering LLMs for a stable and reliable output, generating visemes to interact with premade emotions, and generating voices."
